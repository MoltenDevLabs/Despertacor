- **HTML5:** The foundational markup language ensuring a modern and robust app structure.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A powerful styling tool that adds elegance and responsiveness to the app's design, enhancing user experience.
- **Vue and Nuxt 3:** Dynamic JavaScript frameworks that provide flexibility, interactivity, and speed, resulting in a seamless and engaging user interface.
- **Supabase:** As the backend technology, Supabase empowers the app with data management, security, and scalability, ensuring smooth performance and reliable data handling.
- **Netlify:** The chosen deployment platform, known for its efficiency and hassle-free delivery of the app to users.

## Installation & Setup

To get started with the Coral Despertacor Mobile App, follow these setup instructions.

### Project Minimal Starter

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Deploy on netlify setup

Update your package.json with the following script for Netlify deployment:

```bash
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build"
}
```

Create a netlify.toml file and include the following code:

```bash
[build]
  command = "npm run generate"
  publish = "dist"
```

## Supabase Integration

If your project includes Supabase, make the following configurations:

Update nuxt.config.ts
Add the following code to your nuxt.config.ts file:

```bash
supabase: {
  redirect: false,
  url: process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  key: process.env.SUPABASE_KEY,
},
runtimeConfig: {
  public: {
    supabaseUrl: process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  },
  private: {
    supabaseKey: process.env.SUPABASE_KEY,
  },
}
```

Create a .env file with your Supabase information:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL="https://someUrl.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_KEY="someKey"
```

With these steps, you'll be well-prepared to run and deploy the Coral Mussòlidaria Reus Mobile App.
